# Documentation Search and Answer Visibility

The public site uses VitePress under
`https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/`. This guide covers maintainer work;
search-provider administration does not belong in installation instructions.

## Build and Review

Run `npm run docs:build`, then `npm run docs:preview`. The build checks every
sitemap page for a unique title and description, one main heading, its canonical
URL, internal links and anchors, and FAQ structured answers matching visible
text. It also checks all 19 retired-page redirects, including previously published
screen fragments and their destination anchors. Test the comparison
table and navigation on mobile as well as desktop.

Generated fragments under `docs/generated/` are include-only. Publish useful
reference material through a described, linked wrapper such as
`docs/reference/card-capabilities.md`. Runtime coverage belongs in
`dev-docs/generated/card-runtime-coverage.md`. Do not hand-edit generated tables.

Retired URLs in `docs/.vitepress/discovery.ts` get immediate HTML redirects with
a canonical destination, `noindex`, and a visible fallback link. GitHub Pages
does not provide configurable HTTP 301 redirects. These pages are intentionally
absent from the sitemap. Keep redirect destinations and existing FAQ question
anchors working when reorganising content.

## Content Maintenance

Give each page a distinct, descriptive `title` and `description`. Use the
EspControl brand spelling consistently; VitePress adds the site name once.
Begin guides with the answer or outcome, prerequisites, steps, an observable
success check, and relevant limits. Keep advanced build details below the main
setup path or link to the manual guide.

FAQ JSON-LD is derived from the rendered Markdown's level-three questions and
answers. Edit the visible FAQ; do not add a second hand-maintained answer list.
Keep detailed procedures in their topic guide and link to them from short FAQ
answers. Cite a release or dated verification when describing beta status or
availability; a successful docs build is not physical device testing.

Google says its [AI search features](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-features)
use normal search eligibility and require no special AI file or schema. The
existing `ai.txt` is optional descriptive material, not a crawler control or a
ranking guarantee. [FAQ rich results were retired in May 2026](https://developers.google.com/search/updates).
FAQ schema here keeps the machine-readable content consistent with the page;
it does not promise a rich result.

## Host-root Robots Policy

`/espcontrol/robots.txt` cannot control crawlers. The applicable location is
`https://jtenniswood.github.io/robots.txt`, which returned HTTP 404 during the
September 22, 2026 audit. A missing robots file does not block crawling. The
project-path file has been removed rather than implying it works.

The ready-to-publish [robots.txt](hosting/robots.txt) permits crawling and
announces the docs sitemap. It belongs in the **root** of a GitHub user Pages
site, normally the separate `jtenniswood/jtenniswood.github.io` repository.
That repository was not present in the accessible account during this work.
Publishing it requires creating/configuring that separate host-root site;
deploying EspControl's project site cannot write the host root.
The owner chose to keep the prepared file and instructions; no separate
repository or account-level Pages site was created as part of this change.

After host-root publication, verify:

```bash
curl --fail https://jtenniswood.github.io/robots.txt
curl --fail https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/sitemap.xml
```

The first response must be HTTP 200 with the template's sitemap URL. A generic
allow rule permits search crawling without conflating search access with
provider-specific AI training controls. See Google's
[robots location rules](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/robots-txt/robots-txt-spec).

## Search Console Ownership and Sitemap Submission

These steps require the owner's Google account; GitHub repository access does
not grant Search Console access.

1. Add or select the **URL-prefix** property
   `https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/` in
   [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
   Do not try to verify ownership of the shared `github.io` domain.
2. If unverified, choose HTML-tag verification. Copy only the supplied `content`
   value into the EspControl repository's Actions variable
   `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`. The Pages build places it in the HTML head. This
   public verification value is not an account password or API token.
3. After the Pages deployment, view the homepage source, confirm the exact
   `google-site-verification` value, and complete verification in Search Console.
   Keep the tag deployed after verification.
4. In **Sitemaps**, submit
   `https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/sitemap.xml`. Confirm its processed
   status in the account. This works independently of host-root robots setup.
5. Inspect the homepage, `/screens/`, `/getting-started/install`, and
   `/reference/faq`. Check crawl eligibility and Google's selected canonical.
   Request indexing for the changed landing pages where appropriate.

See Google's [verification tag guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags)
and [sitemap submission guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap).
For Bing, use the owner's Webmaster Tools account to verify the same site and
submit the same sitemap; it is a separate account task.

## Baseline and Follow-up

[The pre-change technical baseline](hosting/seo-baseline-2026-09-22.json) records
the actual live sitemap crawl. It is not a ranking or traffic report. Refresh it
after deployment without changing the original comparison file:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_docs_site.py \
  --base-url https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/ \
  --output /tmp/espcontrol-seo-after.json
```

Before deployment, export the last 28 complete days from Search Console's Web
performance report, including query and page tables, clicks, impressions, CTR,
and average position. Record date range, country/device filters, and deployment
date. Export page-indexing status separately. These account exports were not
available during the technical audit; do not substitute a `site:` search or
crawl count for them.

Compare the same reports over a subsequent 28-day period after recrawling.
Separate branded queries from hardware-model and task queries such as Home
Assistant touchscreen, JC1060P470 setup, Sonos remote, and camera snapshots.
Check whether useful landing pages gain visibility and fragment URLs disappear.
Do not claim causation from small or seasonal changes.

For answer-engine checks, record provider, date, exact prompt, cited URLs, and
factual accuracy for a fixed sample: supported screens, S3 image limits, camera
video support, voice hardware, and installation requirements. Results vary and
are observations, not guaranteed rankings. Google includes AI-feature traffic
within its Web search reporting rather than providing an isolated AEO score.
